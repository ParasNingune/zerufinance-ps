Credit Score Analysis
=====================

Score Distribution
------------------

The credit scores range from 0 to 1000, with higher scores indicating reliable behavior. The distribution plot (score\_distribution.png) shows the number of wallets in each 100-point range (0-100, 100-200, ..., 900-1000).

_Note_: Run the script on your dataset to generate the actual distribution. Expected trends:

*   Most wallets likely fall in the 200-400 range due to the base score and common deposit-heavy behavior.
    
*   Few wallets score above 800, as this requires high repayment ratios and no liquidations.
    
*   Scores below 200 are rare, indicating heavy liquidations or minimal activity.
    

Low-Scoring Wallets (0-200)
---------------------------

*   **Behavior**: Wallets in this range typically have:
    
    *   High liquidation counts, indicating risky borrowing.
        
    *   Low or no repayments, suggesting default or abandonment.
        
    *   Low transaction frequency, possibly bot-like or one-off activity.
        
*   **Example**: A wallet with multiple borrow and liquidationcall actions, no repay actions, and minimal deposits.
    
*   **Implications**: These wallets are high-risk for lending protocols, likely over-leveraged or exploitative.
    

High-Scoring Wallets (800-1000)
-------------------------------

*   **Behavior**: Wallets in this range exhibit:
    
    *   High deposit amounts, showing strong capital commitment.
        
    *   High repayment ratios (close to 1), indicating responsible debt management.
        
    *   No or few liquidations, reflecting stable usage.
        
    *   Moderate to high transaction frequency, suggesting consistent engagement.
        
*   **Example**: A wallet with frequent deposit and repay actions, few or no borrow actions, and no liquidationcall events.
    
*   **Implications**: These wallets are reliable, suitable for higher trust in DeFi protocols.
    

Observations
------------

*   **Skew**: The distribution may skew toward lower scores if liquidations are common in the dataset.
    
*   **Data Dependency**: Scores depend on transaction diversity. Single-transaction wallets (e.g., one deposit) score around 200-300 due to limited repayment or liquidation data.
    
*   **Future Analysis**: With the full 100K dataset, compute:
    
    *   Percentage of wallets per range (e.g., 30% in 200-300).
        
    *   Correlation between features (e.g., liquidation count vs. score).
        
    *   Behavioral patterns by asset type (assetSymbol) or network.
        

Recommendations
---------------

*   **Risk Management**: Flag wallets below 200 for review in lending protocols.
    
*   **Incentives**: Reward wallets above 800 with lower fees or higher borrowing limits.
    
*   **Data Expansion**: Include timestamp for recency or assetSymbol for asset-specific behavior analysis.
